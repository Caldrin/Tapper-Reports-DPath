=head1 NAME

Artemis::Reports::DPath - Extended DPath access to Artemis reports.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Artemis::Reports::DPath 'reports_dpath_search';
    # the first bogomips entry of math sections:
    @resultlist = reports_dpath_search(
                     '{ suite_name => "TestSuite-LmBench" } :: /tap/section/math/*/bogomips[0]'
                  );
    # all report IDs of suite_id 17 that FAILed:
    @resultlist = reports_dpath_search(
                     '{ suite_name => "TestSuite-LmBench" } :: /suite_id[value == 17]/../successgrade[value eq 'FAIL']/../id'
                  );

This searches all reports of the test suite "TestSuite-LmBench" and
furthermore in them for a TAP section "math" with the particular
subtest "bogomips" and takes the first array entry of them.

The part before the '::' selects reports to search in a DBIx::Class
search query, the second part is a normal L<Data::DPath|Data::DPath>
expression that matches against the datastructure that is build from
the DB.

=head1 EXPORT

A list of functions that can be exported.  You can delete this section
if you don't export anything, such as for a purely object-oriented
module.

=head1 METHODS and FUNCTIONS

=head2 reports_dpath_search
